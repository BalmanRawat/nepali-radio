A poor guy's solution to listen Nepali Radio's in command line. Easiest would be to find some streaming
link and play through the player that has streaming support.


* Application Logic
  - Get Radio/FM link
    - curl the [[http://radio.nepal.fm/radio-feed/][radio-feed]] in ~$HOME/.radio-feed.xml~
    - parse the file and save in ~$HOME/.radio-feed~
  - give the options to select the radio links
